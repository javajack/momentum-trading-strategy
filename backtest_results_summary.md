## 4. IDENTIFIED WEAKNESSES & IMPROVEMENT AREAS

### AllWeather Weaknesses Observed

1. **2025 Recovery Phase (Mar-Jun 2025)**: Classic won +13.9% vs +11.9%
   - AllWeather underperformed by 2% during quick recovery
   - RS filter may have been too strict during fast reversals
   - Potential fix: Faster RS recalculation or recovery mode

2. **18-Month Period**: Classic +5.26% vs AllWeather -4.03%
   - This period includes the 2024 Q4 correction and partial recovery
   - AllWeather was slow to re-enter after the correction
   - Potential fix: Adaptive RS thresholds based on regime

3. **Lower Win Rate in Some Phases**:
   - 2022 Recovery: Classic 88.9% vs AllWeather 80.0%
   - May be holding losing positions too long
   - Potential fix: Tighter stops in early positions

4. **Higher Drawdowns in Time-Based Tests**:
   - 6M: AllWeather -3.38% vs Classic -1.43%
   - 12M: AllWeather -6.03% vs Classic -3.85%
   - The stricter filters may cause concentration risk
   - Potential fix: Better position sizing or sector diversification

### AllWeather Strengths to Preserve

1. **Strong Bull Market Performance**: +44% avg vs +33.6% (Classic)
2. **Bear Market Protection**: -4.3% avg vs -8.2% (Classic)
3. **Lower Trade Frequency**: 30-40% fewer trades
4. **Better Sharpe Ratios**: Higher in 6 of 8 phases
5. **Better Drawdown Control**: Lower in 6 of 8 phases

## 5. CURRENT ALLWEATHER CONFIGURATION (config.yaml)

```yaml
strategy_allweather:
  # Relative Strength settings
  use_relative_strength: true
  rs_weight: 0.25                   # How much RS affects score (0-0.5)
  min_rs_threshold: 1.05            # Must beat index by 5% for entry
  rs_exit_threshold: 0.95           # Exit if RS drops below 0.95

  # Momentum acceleration
  use_momentum_acceleration: true
  min_acceleration: 0.95            # Must not be decelerating badly

  # Exhaustion detection
  use_exhaustion_detection: true
  exhaustion_exit_threshold: 60     # Exit if exhaustion score >= 60

  # Tiered adaptive stops (let winners run with wider stops)
  use_adaptive_stops: true
  tier2_trailing: 0.15              # 8-20% gain: 15% trailing

## 6. POTENTIAL IMPROVEMENTS TO EXPLORE

1. **Regime-Adaptive RS Thresholds**
   - Lower RS threshold (1.02) during recovery phases
   - Higher RS threshold (1.08) during extended bull markets
   - Use regime detection to auto-adjust

2. **Dynamic Exhaustion Levels**
   - Lower exhaustion threshold (50) in sideways markets
   - Higher threshold (70) in strong trends
   - Prevents premature exits in trending markets

3. **Recovery Mode Detection**
   - After significant drawdown (>10%), temporarily relax filters
   - Allow faster re-entry into recovering stocks
   - Auto-expire after 2-3 months

4. **Sector-Based RS Adjustments**
   - Some sectors naturally have different RS characteristics
   - Defensive sectors may have lower RS but still be good holds
   - Consider sector-relative RS

5. **Volatility-Adjusted Stops**
   - Current tiered stops are fixed percentages
   - High-volatility stocks may need wider stops
   - Low-volatility stocks could use tighter stops

6. **Momentum Acceleration Tuning**
   - Current min_acceleration: 0.95
   - May be too strict in sideways markets
   - Consider regime-based acceleration thresholds

7. **Entry Timing Optimization**
   - AllWeather may be entering too late in recoveries
   - Consider "breakout anticipation" signals
   - Use volume patterns to detect early momentum

8. **Position Sizing by Conviction**
   - Higher RS stocks get larger positions
   - Lower RS (but qualifying) stocks get smaller positions
   - Dynamic sizing within bounds
